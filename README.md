# Lemonade bot🍋
## Hobby project written in python using [aoigram](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram)
### Discription
Admins can upload songs and edit them in every possible way, and users can receive these songs with one click. The bot uses unique file IDs in the telegram, which means that when your bot is blocked, the entire database will become inoperable.
